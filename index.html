		<p>Artificial Intelligence
			Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be defined as a <dfn>“branch of computer science by which we can create intelligent machines which can behave like a human, 
			think like humans, and able to make decisions”.</dfn> AI exists when a machine can have human based skills such as learning, reasoning, and solving problems. 
			The AI is now all around us. It is currently working with a variety of subfields, ranging from general to specific, such as self-driving cars, playing chess, 
			proving theorems, playing music, Painting, etc. AI is one of the fascinating and universal fields of Computer science which has a great scope in future. 
		    AI holds a tendency to cause a machine to work as a human.</p>
			<p>With Artificial Intelligence you do not need to preprogram a machine to do some work, 
			despite that you can create a machine with programmed algorithms which can work with own intelligence, and that is the awesomeness of AI. 
			AI is not just a part of computer science even it's so vast and requires lots of other factors which can contribute to it. 
			To create the AI first we should know that how intelligence is composed, so the Intelligence is an intangible part of our brain which is a combination of 
			Reasoning, learning, problem-solving perception, language understanding, etc. Artificial Intelligence requires the following discipline: 
			<ul>
				<li>Mathematics</li>
				<li>Programming</li> 
				<li>Psychology</li> 
				<li>Computer Science</li> 
				<li>Neurons Study</li> 
				<li>Statistics</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			Artificial Intelligence has various applications in today's society. 
			Following are some sectors which have the application of Artificial Intelligence: 
			<ol type="1">
				<li>Gaming</li>
				<li>Healthcare</li> 
				<li>Finance</li> 
				<li>Social Media</li> 
				<li>Robotics</li>
				<li>Agriculture</li> 
				<li>E-commerce</li> 
				<li>Education</li>
			</ol>
